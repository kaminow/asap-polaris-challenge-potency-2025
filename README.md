This repo is currently being used as a rough space to publicly store the scripts I've
been using to ingest data, train models, run inference, and submit predictions to the
challenge. Once the challenge is over, I will come back and organize things a bit
better.

The competitions can be found at https://polarishub.io/competitions. This repo is
specificall for the [potency challenge](https://polarishub.io/competitions/asap-discovery/antiviral-potency-2025).
